# Create Contentful/HUGO app

The easiest way to kickstart a new jamstack project using contentful and hugo is by using `create-contentful-hugo-app`.
This CLI tool enables you to quickly setup a new contentful-hugo application, with everything set up for you.
To get started, use the following command:

```bash
npx @jungvonmatt/create-contentful-hugo-app
```

To create a new app in a specific folder, you can send a name as an argument. For example, the following command will create a new contentful-hugo project called `blog-app` in a folder with the same name:

```bash
npx @jungvonmatt/create-contentful-hugo-app blog-app
```
