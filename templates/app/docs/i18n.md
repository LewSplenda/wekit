# i18n

## String Translations

All `d-i18n` content entries are automatically collected and and stored as hugo i18n configuration files during the build process.
See https://gohugo.io/content-management/multilingual/#translation-of-strings.

The configured translations can then be with the [`i18n`](https://gohugo.io/functions/i18n/) function.

```go
{{ i18n "translation_id" }} -> Value
{{ i18n "translation_id" (dict "Count" 1)}} -> Singular value
```

You can edit all available translations in contentful:
https://app.contentful.com/spaces/CONTENTFUL-SPACE-ID/entries?contentTypeId=d-i18n

## hreflang tags

WEKit automatically takes care of providing hreflang tags if a page is available in multiple languages.

## How to use without i18n

In case you don't want to use contentful as the source of truth for your translations, you can also edit the translation files directly in
the respective language files `i18n/<locale>.yaml`;
