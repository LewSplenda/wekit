# Contentful

## Setup

### Requirements

Install all dependencies: see [README.md](../README.md).

### Initial setup

Create a new space in contentful and change the default locale (settings/locales) from `en-US` to `en`. Or you can also use the [space create command](https://github.com/contentful/contentful-cli/tree/master/docs/space/create).

### Content model

Your content model is managed via migration files in a structured and reproducible way. If you have created this project using the [create-wekit-app](https://github.com/jungvonmatt/create-wekit-app) CLI, you should already have some basic content models available.
See the [migration](./Migrations.md) docs for more information about scripting migrations and the workflow behind.
